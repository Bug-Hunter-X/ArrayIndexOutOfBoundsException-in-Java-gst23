# ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in Java

This repository demonstrates a common Java error: the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.  The code attempts to access an array element beyond its defined bounds, leading to a runtime exception.

The `bug.java` file contains the erroneous code.  The `bugSolution.java` file shows the corrected version.

This example highlights the importance of carefully checking array indices to prevent runtime errors.
